# BugRecognition

To run my code, you will have to pull all files, and run the program called “Test.” 
This will come out with an error unless you have added the TensorFlow and 
Flite_Runtime.Interpreter libraries.

Test.py is actually the main file, it is where my bug is now. All you will need to run
this are the two classes previously named.

clothing.py was my first attempt at using the tensorflow API to create clothing recognition

labelImage.py is just a helper file that gets the data file for the clothes

main.py was just a testing file that I used to debug issues in other files.
